# Triax-Painting-tSZ
Painting algorithm to N-body simulation using a GNFW profile with triaxiality. Equations were partially obtained from [Kim et al 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04794) to define elliptical coordinates. y-profile is completelly based on [Battaglia et al 2016](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/758/2/75/pdf)
